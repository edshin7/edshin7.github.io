My project is a game that creates a 2D version of an 
iPhone cube game known as Edge. The main idea of this 
was to replicate the unique interactions of the player's 
cube with the other blocks and solids it touches.

There are no special requirements for this project's 
installation. Just make sure to have a good editer like 
Sublime to run the program.

My project is a game that creates a 2D version of an 
iPhone game known as Edge. The main goal of this project 
was to bring out as much of the experience of the original
3D game into the 2D one. This experience mainly comes from 
how the cube moves and interacts with other blocks and solids
to reach the goal. Along with features like collecting prizes
and activating triggers, I strove to bring out the best of Edge 
to make even the 2D setting just as engaging and enjoyable.


My main program of study is the original game, Edge. I really 
enjoyed how the cube was programmed to do impossible tasks like
balancing itself on the edge of a side block or solid It gave me 
a more broad view of how characters could interact in a game. I also 
appreciated how the games uses tries instead of lives so that this 
unique game experience is not forcefully interrupted by sending the 
player to the main page on a typical game over scenario. one thing I 
would question are the sponteous events that occur even though a 
trigger is not activated. It is not as big of a problem, but I think 
it would even more interesting for the player to cause it, whether it
is beneficial or not.Nonetheless, I truly enjoyed recreating the game 
to bring a 2D field while maintaining all the fun features of the 
original Edge game.

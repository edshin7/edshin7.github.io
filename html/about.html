                <h2>Hello</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Edward Shin. Thanks for taking the time to visit my website and profile. Just to clarify, this site
                    holds all of my software and technology related projects, like web applications, interactive media, games, 3D-Print, 
                    and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first started at Carnegie Mellon University as an aspiring architect because I absolutely loved design and immersive spaces. 
                    But, along the way, I ran into computer science, something I touched during my second year in high school. Feeling an unusual urge,
                    I decided to give it another try, and I found great joy in programming applications and interactive media. 
                    While continuing my studies in Architecture, I took several computer science courses and studied game/media design to learn 
                    and explore the possibilities with technology and design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2018, I graduated with a major in Architecture and minors in game 
                    Design and Media Design. From there, I continued my computer education in Coding Dojo and graduated with newfound knowledge in Full-Stack and 
                    Mobile App Development. Even now, I still take many opportunities to learn more and improve further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from programming and design, I love to do art (drawing, painting, modeling), read/write fantasy stories, and make/play video games.

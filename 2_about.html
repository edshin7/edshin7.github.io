                    <h4>My Coding History</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>My name is Edward Shin. I am a designer, a programmer, and a writer.
                         Computers was the beginning of my long journey. My first love for coding
                         started with my love for games. I took a game development course at the
                         age of 12 with Game Maker 5. After learning the basics, I explored the 
                         software more and created more complex games.</p>

                    <p>During my second year of high school, I studied computer science with Java. I 
                         was drilled in all the basics of the programming language and how to solve
                         problems. Towards the end of my senior year, I came across a renowned computer
                         game called "Cave Story" created by Software Engineer Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya. I 
                         immediately fell in love with its plotline and its retro-like style, a style 
                         that I had been denied because of my parents' refusal to allow me to own a 
                         game console at a young age.</p>

                    <p>Once I got into Carnegie Mellon University, I started studying in the School of 
                         Architecture - as I thought computer science was overwhelming during high 
                         school. During my second semester of my first year of college, however, I was
                         introduced to Processing, a programming platform for artists. My love for this 
                         software not only rekindled my passion for programming, but it also led me to 
                         pursue Carnegie Mellon's IDeaTe program, where students can learn about 
                         combining technology with art. I studied media and game design, and took a few
                         courses from the Computer Science department. I hope to graduate and continue
                         to learn more about computers and design</p>
                         <br />
                    <h4>Skills</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>I know Java, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Python, Processing 2.0 + 3.0, and p5.js. 
                         Currently learning to code with Swift and Three.js.</p>
                         <br />
                    <h4>Other Interests</h4>
                         <br />
                    <p>Aside from programming, I love writing stories, constructing models, playing piano 
                         and drawing figures and characters</p>

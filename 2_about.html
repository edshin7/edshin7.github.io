        <h1>Welcome to my world.</h1>

        <h2>My Coding History</h2>

        <p>My name is Edward Shin. I am a designer, a programmer, and an amateur writer.
           <br />Computers was the beginning of my long journey. My first love for coding
           <br />started with my love for games. I took a game development course at the
           <br />age of 12 with Game Maker 5. After learning the basics, I explored the 
           <br />software more and created more complex games.</p>

        <p>During my second year of high school, I studied computer science with Java. I 
           <br />was drilled in all the basics of the programming language and how to solve
           <br />problems. Towards the end of my senior year, I came across a renowned game 
           <br />called "Cave Story" created by Software Engineer Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya. I 
           <br />immediately fell in love with its plotline and its retro-like style, a style 
           <br />that I had been denied because of my parents' refusal to allow me to own a 
           <br />game console at a young age.</p>

        <p>Once I got into Carnegie Mellon University, I started studying in the School of 
           <br />Architecture - as I thought computer science was overwhelming during high 
           <br />school. During my second semester of my first year of college, however, I was
           <br />introduced to Processing, a programming platform for artists. My love for this 
           <br />software not only rekindled my passion for programming, but it also led me to 
           <br />pursue Carnegie Mellon's IDeaTe program, where students can learn about 
           <br />combining technology with art. I studied media and game design, and took a few
           <br />courses from the Computer Science department. I hope to graduate and continue
           <br />to learn more about computers and art combined.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p>I know JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Python, Processing 2, and p5.js.</p>

        <h2>Other Interests</h2>

        <p>Aside from programming, I love writing stories, constructing models, and drawing 
           <br />figures and characters</p>
